                    <p>Modern Day Live Cell Therapy achieved global credibility by the painstaking research of Dr. Paul Niehans, who in 1931 made outstanding contributions to the advancement of the technique of organ extraction and cell therapy. Due to its phenomenal success, Cell Therapy has achieved global prominence as an effective regenerative technique.</p>
                    <p>Cell Therapy works on cell stimulation and renewal within your body and is non-invasive. Celergen is a food supplement and the beneAts of cell therapy are encapsulated in the soft gels for oral ingestion. Therefore it is safe and harmless.</p>

                    <p>In the 80′s, a renowned German cell therapist introduced marine cell therapy via extraction of DNA cell extracts from the embryo of Ash. He injected marine cell extract onto himself and his diseased patients.</p>

Using the same principles of cell therapy via a patented cold DNA extraction process of the bio cellular DNA extracts from deep sea Ash, which is environmentally pollution free from the deep ocean of France and hence Celergen was developed.</p>

                    <p> BIIODNA Ceelllluullaarr Maarriinnee Coompplleexx
					Celergen’s Swiss, French and German scientists, after intensive research, have discovered the powerful anti-aging properties in deep sea
					marine life. They have harnessed the power of this underwater treasury to formulate BIODNA CELLULAR MARINE COMPLEX. This is
					produced from premium quality marine life by Celergen’s exclusively patented proprietary biological DNA extraction technology.
					This superior extraction technology prevents the depolymerisation of the active ingredients and guarantees the potency of the product.
					BIODNA CELLULAR MARINE COMPLEX is also a super anti-oxidant speciAcally designed to act as a protective agent against cell oxidative
					aggression.
					In addition to its healing properties, Celergen has been clinically proven to be extremely affective in replenishing energy and stamina with
					amazing speed for athletes – the perfect recuperative nutritional supplement.
					PEEPTIIDEE EE COLLLLAGEEN
					PEPTIDE E COLLAGEN comprises the highest premium grade quality collagen and elastin peptides from France and has been proven to
					reinforce skin hydration and elasticity. The moisturizing effects of PEPTIDE E COLLAGEN are supported by clinical studies involving
					women over 40 years old. The results have shown an increase of the entire epidermis hydration after an oral administration of Celergen’s
					PEPTIDE E COLLAGEN over a period of 3 months. (See results of clinical studies)
					It has also been reported that Peptide E Collagen helps to improve bone density in people who suffer from protein malnutrition and joint
					diseases. There are also several reports of hair thickness increase and improvement in the treatment of cases of nail disorder after a
					prolonged ingestion of Celergen.
					HYDRO MN PEEPTIIDEE
					HYDRO MN PEPTIDE plays a critical role in the regeneration of cartilage, treatment of osteoarthritis and improves the biodynamic of the
					skin. It is also a Glycemic Index (GI) lowering peptide and has been clinically proven in reducing the GI of Carbohydrates by 37% which
					would otherwise be converted into fats and accumulate in our body.</p>

                <div id="accordion-47" class="accordion-section-content">
                    <p>Cell renewal is an ongoing process within our bodies since our conception and continues throughout our life, as old and weak cells are
					replaced by new ones. This process of renewal is critical to keep our body tissues and organ in optimum health and therefore it cannot
					cause an increase in blood pressure.
					Celergen encapsulates the transformative power of cell renewal and therefore it can bring us positive beneAts like enhancing our metabolic
					rate and increase blood “Circulation”. Once again, Celergen is a Food Supplement and therefore it cannot increase one’s blood pressure.
					The terminology “Increased blood pressure” is more relevant to Hypertension or High Blood Pressure.
					Patients diagnosed with hypertension have in common a particular abnormality of the arteries: an increased resistance (stiffness or lack of
					elasticity) in the tiny arteries that are most distant from the heart (peripheral arteries or arterioles). The arterioles supply oxygen-containing
					blood and nutrients to all of the tissues of the body. The arterioles are connected by capillaries in the tissues to the veins (the venous
					system), which returns the blood to the heart and lungs.
					Hypertension is usually associated with genetic factors, obesity, lack of exercise, overuse of salt, and aging. Inlammation also may play a
					role in hypertension.
					Celergen is not a drug and therefore it cannot cure hypertension but it can help prevent the clotting of arteries – useful as a prevention
					health supplement.</p>

A change in the sleeping position or a simple movement such as head tilt can also cause vertigo. The resurfacing of vertigo cannot be due to Celergen. It is advisable that she goes for a trial and error approach i.e. take Celergen for a week and if her vertigo problem resurfaces, she can then stop Celergen. She can resume when she recovers. With this method we hope to convince her that her vertigo is deAnitely not due to Celergen.</p>

					My suggestion is that you persist with Celergen and I am quite optimistic that your pain will subside. I personally experience pain on my

It is scientiAcally not possible that Celergen can transfer pain from one area of the body to another. It is also not possible that it will create problems as described in your email.</p>
                    <p>Celergen is a food supplement aimed at improving you overall health and wellbeing. There are clinical studies to show that the ingredients

					I really empathize with your current problems and I recommend that you see a doctor with regard to your pain on your heels and your left
					toe fast.
					The sharpening pain may have been caused by crystal deposits surrounding the joints, toes etc. or what is commonly known as ‘ uric acid
					symptoms ‘. There are medications to be taken to control the pain and you will have to change your eating habits. The natural way of
					treating uric acid symptoms would be taking celery supplements which are available in any drug food store. Prolong untreated uric acid will

                    <p>There are no contra indications when you take Celergen. However, it is important to remember that Celergen does not treat both the above
					conditions.
					Please consult your doctors for your Candida (a condition of yeast overgrowth) as it must be treated properly and thoroughly. Once
					diagnosed and it’ll affect the functioning of your entire system. Avoiding sugar is a must as the consumption of sugar will only make it
					worse and if possible all the ‘whites’ i.e. white sugar, white lour, white rice (to be replaced by brown rice ) etc.
					As for leaky gut syndrome, it is an autointoxication process which is an integral part of many chronic conditions. When autointoxication
					occurs e.g. Constipation, then it’ll lead to the formation of toxic chemical and this in turn irritates the wall of the bowel, leading to the
					increased permeability to gut derived antigens, allowing them to leak through the gut into the circulation system. Because they are toxic to
					the system and causes inlammation, Celergen will help the above by strengthening the immune system and keep the condition mildly
					under control BUT does not treat the syndrome.
					Please avoid the food that is causing problem and a thorough detox program will be good besides adding enzymes and friendly bacteria to
