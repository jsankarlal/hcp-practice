                        <p>In the 80â€²s, a renowned German cell therapist introduced marine cell therapy via extraction of DNA cell extracts from the embryo of Ash. He injected marine cell extract onto himself and his diseased patients.</p>
                        <p>After years of technological research, the Swiss cell therapists continued the research and worked closely with French biologists and chemists to register marine cell therapy in Europe. Using the same principles of cell therapy via a patented cold DNA extraction process of the bio cellular DNA extracts from deep sea Ash, which is environmentally pollution free from the deep ocean of France and hence Celergen was developed.</p>

                            Celergenâ€™s Swiss, French and German scientists, after intensive research, have discovered the powerful anti-aging properties in deep sea
                            marine life. They have harnessed the power of this underwater treasury to formulate BIODNA CELLULAR MARINE COMPLEX. This is
                            produced from premium quality marine life by Celergenâ€™s exclusively patented proprietary biological DNA extraction technology.
                            This superior extraction technology prevents the depolymerisation of the active ingredients and guarantees the potency of the product.

                            PEPTIDE E COLLAGEN comprises the highest premium grade quality collagen and elastin peptides from France and has been proven to
                            reinforce skin hydration and elasticity. The moisturizing effects of PEPTIDE E COLLAGEN are supported by clinical studies involving
                            women over 40 years old. The results have shown an increase of the entire epidermis hydration after an oral administration of Celergenâ€™s
                            PEPTIDE E COLLAGEN over a period of 3 months. (See results of clinical studies)
                            It has also been reported that Peptide E Collagen helps to improve bone density in people who suffer from protein malnutrition and joint
                            diseases. There are also several reports of hair thickness increase and improvement in the treatment of cases of nail disorder after a
                            prolonged ingestion of Celergen.

                            Cell renewal is an ongoing process within our bodies since our conception and continues throughout our life, as old and weak cells are
                            replaced by new ones. This process of renewal is critical to keep our body tissues and organ in optimum health and therefore it cannot
                            cause an increase in blood pressure.
                            Celergen encapsulates the transformative power of cell renewal and therefore it can bring us positive beneAts like enhancing our metabolic
                            rate and increase blood â€œCirculationâ€�. Once again, Celergen is a Food Supplement and therefore it cannot increase oneâ€™s blood pressure.
                            The terminology â€œIncreased blood pressureâ€� is more relevant to Hypertension or High Blood Pressure.
                            Patients diagnosed with hypertension have in common a particular abnormality of the arteries: an increased resistance (stiffness or lack of
                            elasticity) in the tiny arteries that are most distant from the heart (peripheral arteries or arterioles). The arterioles supply oxygen-containing
                            blood and nutrients to all of the tissues of the body. The arterioles are connected by capillaries in the tissues to the veins (the venous
                            system), which returns the blood to the heart and lungs.
                            Hypertension is usually associated with genetic factors, obesity, lack of exercise, overuse of salt, and aging. Inlammation also may play a
                            role in hypertension.
                            Celergen is not a drug and therefore it cannot cure hypertension but it can help prevent the clotting of arteries - useful as a prevention
                            health supplement.

A change in the sleeping position or a simple movement such as head tilt can also cause vertigo. The resurfacing of vertigo cannot be due to Celergen. It is advisable that she goes for a trial and error approach i.e. take Celergen for a week and if her vertigo problem resurfaces, she can then stop Celergen. She can resume when she recovers. With this method we hope to convince her that her vertigo is deAnitely not due to Celergen.</p>

                            Celergen cannot cause such pain because it is a Food Supplement. Celergen will â€œalertâ€� the consumer about his/her health problems. It
                            cannot create the pain but it can alert you as to the potential health problems that you may be having that you are not aware of.
                            My suggestion is that you persist with Celergen and I am quite optimistic that your pain will subside. I personally experience pain on my
                            right heel on and off but after taking Celergen for about 2 months, the pain has gone. But sometimes when I over exercise, it comes back
                            and then goes off again. The beneAt about Celergen is that it does alleviate the pain and therefore the pain is â€œnever permanentâ€�. That is
                            most important for me.
                            Sometimes our lifestyle impacts our overall wellbeing. The question to ask is that without Celergen, can our life be better? For me, it is
                            better with Celergen than without it. Of course, Celergen does not solve all my health problems because it is not a drug or medicine. It is a
                            health supplement.

It is scientiAcally not possible that Celergen can transfer pain from one area of the body to another. It is also not possible that it will create problems as described in your email.</p>
                        <p>
                            Celergen is a food supplement aimed at improving you overall health and wellbeing. There are clinical studies to show that the ingredients
                            helped various participants in the reduction of pain pertaining to rheumatoid arthritis and other inlammation. However, as emphasized, it
                            is more of prevention than cure and also the results vary among individuals.
                            I really empathize with your current problems and I recommend that you see a doctor with regard to your pain on your heels and your left
                            toe fast.
                            The sharpening pain may have been caused by crystal deposits surrounding the joints, toes etc. or what is commonly known as â€˜ uric acid
                            symptoms â€˜. There are medications to be taken to control the pain and you will have to change your eating habits. The natural way of
                            treating uric acid symptoms would be taking celery supplements which are available in any drug food store. Prolong untreated uric acid will
                            ultimately lead to degeneration of the kidney.

                            I have to emphasize once again that Celergen is a food supplement and even though we have extensive certiAcations and clinical studies,
                            we really want to market it as a health supplement. Still, I really appreciate your conAdence in Celergen.
                            Just for your information, some of our members literally breaks the casing and just consume the liquid gel encased on a daily basis.
                            To only ingest the contents of Celergen will yield results even though we could not extrapolate results from one person to the other. So, if a
                            customer can ingest Celergen in its soft gel form, please do so. Remember, for Celergen (liquid within the gel) will have to go through the
                            stomach, which is acidic by nature. This will mean that we may not have the full absorption as compared to taking the whole soft gel which
                            will bypass the stomach and go through our intestines.
                            If our body can absorb 50% of the contents why reduce it purposely to 10% unless due to unavoidable circumstances.

                            There are no contra indications when you take Celergen. However, it is important to remember that Celergen does not treat both the above
                            conditions.
                            Please consult your doctors for your Candida (a condition of yeast overgrowth) as it must be treated properly and thoroughly. Once
                            diagnosed and itâ€™ll affect the functioning of your entire system. Avoiding sugar is a must as the consumption of sugar will only make it
                            worse and if possible all the â€˜whitesâ€™ i.e. white sugar, white lour, white rice (to be replaced by brown rice ) etc.
                            As for leaky gut syndrome, it is an autointoxication process which is an integral part of many chronic conditions. When autointoxication
                            occurs e.g. Constipation, then itâ€™ll lead to the formation of toxic chemical and this in turn irritates the wall of the bowel, leading to the
                            increased permeability to gut derived antigens, allowing them to leak through the gut into the circulation system. Because they are toxic to
                            the system and causes inlammation, Celergen will help the above by strengthening the immune system and keep the condition mildly
                            under control BUT does not treat the syndrome.
                            Please avoid the food that is causing problem and a thorough detox program will be good besides adding enzymes and friendly bacteria to
                            your daily regime.

                        <p>Celergen is primarily used for cell renewal and repair; therefore it is usually advised that cancer patients take Celergen after chemo. It is harmless to take Celergen before chemo except that the Swiss Coordinator thinks that it is a waste to do so if the person is going to go through chemo (which is a treatment that massively destroys the cells). She also advised that it is not necessary to take Celergen during chemo treatments because the beneAts of Celergen cannot be optimized. It is harmless but then again maybe a waste.</p>

                            Celergen encapsulates the concept of Cell Therapy by empowering our body with the Nutrients and Peptides to do Cell Repair and Renewal
                            for our health. Based on the various Independent Celergen Clinical Studies conducted, some of our customers with e.g knee pain, back
                            pain beneAted from Celergen and recovered in 3-10 days; others have to take Celergen for 3-6 months before they experience signiAcant
                            beneAts. In some cases, the pain did not go away but the customers have experienced improvements in functional mobility and they are
                            happy.
                            The results experienced by patients or customer differ depending on our body repair system and the time period of recovery will also differ.
                            Lutein as an ingredient is known for preventing macular degeneration of the eyes and therefore Celergen will deAnitely be useful for your
                            customer. In addition, she will still beneAt from the overall improvement in health and its Anti-Aging properties.
                            We do have customers with eyes problems beneAting from Celergen but once again, the results differ from individuals. The symptoms of
                            the illness may be similar but Celergen is positioned only for prevention, even though some of our customers are fortunate to have much
                            â€œunexpected recovery surprisesâ€�.
                            My suggestion is that you persist taking Celergen up to 3 months and then decide if you want to continue. It is important to remember that
                            Celergen is not positioned to cure diseases even though we do have clinical studies to show that some of the study subjects had

                            Usually for patients above 75 years old, we recommend 2 tablets a day. But for starters, they should take 1 tablet a day so that their body

                            For patients with chronic gastric problems, it is better to take Celergen after food. However, we do have many customers who are able to

                        &nbsp; 74. As I know that Celergen also contain collagen but I donâ€™t know how much is the dose. If currently I already on collagen supplement 5300mg, so is there any harm Iâ€™m taking Celergen at the same time.

                        <p>The collagen with Elastin dosage in Celergen is 230 mg. From your email, we were informed that you are taking a collagen supplement of 5300 mg, the key question is does this supplement comes with Elastin?</p>
                        <p>For your information, there are different grades of collagen. The peptide E collagen in Celergen is derived from premium quality Ash extracts (French Sanitation Approval number FR 62667123 and FR 62667125 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 of the European Parliament).</p>
                        <p>In addition collagen has to be combined with elastin in order for the product to be potent and effective. Last but not least, normal collagen are usually produced in huge molecules, which means that even if we take 10,000 mg of such collagen, the absorption will be compromised because our skin will not be able to absorbed.</p>
                        <p>The peptide E Collagen in Celergen is the same ratio as our dermis and therefore we will be able to absorb the collagen and experience the beneAts.</p>

                        &nbsp; 75. I suffered from stroke twice due to arterivenous malformation (AVM). After intensive physiotherapy I was able to recover from stroke. However, due to Gamma Knife Treatment that I underwent, the healthy tissue surrounding the AVM was affected rendering the left side of my body paralyzed again. Iâ€™m able to almost do everything a normal person can do, but I have little control over my left hand, including the fine motoric movement. I also suffer from grand mal epilepsy after my second stroke. After reading the Celergen website, I wonder if Celergen can regenerate brain cells and help me recover from my illness.

                        <p>Thank you for your email. I am sorry about your struggles with your challenging health conditions but I must say that you seem positive and strong. That is wonderful.</p>
                        <p>Celergen is a food supplement and not a drug, even though it encapsulates the concept of cell renewal and repair, we cannot promise that it will work for speciAc conditions that we are trying to treat. However, according to the testimonies of many of our customers, there is overwhelming evidence to show that Celergen works like a effective nutritional supplement that triggers and stimulate cell repair, giving energy, mood elevation and overall physical mobility for patients suffering from metabolic ailments.</p>
                        <p>We had a customer who used to suffer from migraines and had to have botox every 3 weeks to ease the muscle tension and pain but after taking Celergen, she does not need to go for botox for almost 8 months now. We had another patient from UAE and he had serious arthritis and was not able to walk for a long time but after taking Celergen for about 3 months, he was able to walk without difAculty. I have to inform you that results vary according to individuals because nutritional supplement like Celergen acts as a trigger to stimulate your cells to repair damage areas that is provided your cells do the necessary work.</p>
                        <p>
                            I would strongly recommend that you try Celergen because you really have nothing to lose here. Overall Celergen will still improve your health and provide potent nutrition to activate your body to create proteins, enzymes for your body. You should take 2 soft gels a day for about 3 months and monitor your overall condition. Please try to take it 4 hours apart from your other medication - preferably Arst thing in
                            the morning before breakfast (if you have no gastric problems).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am conAdent you will And your overall health situation including your mood and energy levels improving. If Celergen cannot help reverse your paralysis state, I do know doctors in Switzerland who does stem cell implantation in Switzerland and other parts of Asia who can hopefully provide better solutions for your problem. If you are interested, I can always recommend you to them for evaluation. By the way,
                            most of the cell therapy doctors will recommend Celergen to their patients before and after the cell therapy treatment for maintenance.
